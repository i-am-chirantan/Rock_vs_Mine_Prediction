# Rock vs. Mine Classification Project

This project aims to classify underwater objects as either rocks or mines using sonar data. We will follow a structured workflow to achieve this goal, which includes collecting the sonar data, preprocessing the data, performing train-test split, and feeding the data to a logistic regression model for classification.

## Workflow

### 1. Collecting Sonar Data

#### Data Source

**Dataset**: The sonar data for this project was obtained from the [Kaggle dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mattcarter865/mines-vs-rocks?select=sonar.all-data.csv).

**Data Description**: The dataset consists of sonar signals, where each signal corresponds to a specific object in the water, which is either a rock or a mine (metal cylinder).

##### Data Description

The dataset consists of sonar signals, where each signal corresponds to a specific object in the water, which is either a rock or a mine (metal cylinder).

##### Data Collection Steps

* Download the dataset from the provided source or any other suitable source.
* Explore the dataset to understand its structure and features.

### 2. Preprocessing the Data

 **Data Cleaning** :

* Check for missing values in the dataset and decide how to handle them.
* Remove any irrelevant or redundant features if necessary.

 **Feature Engineering** :

* Create relevant features or transform existing features to improve model performance.

 **Data Scaling and Normalization** :

* Scale and normalize the features to ensure that all input variables have the same scale.

### 3. Train-Test Split

 **Data Splitting** :

* Split the dataset into two subsets: a training set and a testing (or validation) set. A common split ratio is 80% for training and 20% for testing.

 **Purpose** :

* The training set is used to train the logistic regression model.
* The testing set is used to evaluate the model's performance and assess its ability to generalize to unseen data.

### 4. Building the Logistic Regression Model

 **Model Selection** :

* Choose the logistic regression algorithm as the classification model for this project.

 **Model Training** :

* Train the logistic regression model using the training data.

 **Model Evaluation** :

* Evaluate the model's performance on the testing dataset using appropriate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
* Visualize the results, e.g., using confusion matrices or ROC curves, to gain insights into the model's performance.

 **Hyperparameter Tuning** :

* Fine-tune hyperparameters of the logistic regression model, if necessary, using techniques like cross-validation.

### 5. Model Deployment (Optional)

* Deploy the trained logistic regression model for real-world predictions if the project requires it.
